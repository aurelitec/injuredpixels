InjuredPixels
=============

Check your screen for dead, stuck, or hot pixels on LCD and OLED
displays.

Use InjuredPixels to test a new monitor before purchasing, or during
the warranty period - you may qualify for a replacement under the
manufacturer's dead pixel policy. InjuredPixels fills the entire
screen with a solid color, allowing you to inspect every pixel for
defects.


Getting Started
---------------

Open InjuredPixels.html in any modern browser. No installation or
internet connection required.

  1. Select a color from the control panel.
  2. Press F to enter fullscreen mode.
  3. Press Space or right-click to hide the controls.
  4. Inspect the screen for pixels that don't match the color.
  5. Repeat for each color.


Test Colors
-----------

InjuredPixels includes 8 test colors, each designed to reveal
different types of pixel defects:

  Red, Green, Blue         Test individual subpixels
  Cyan, Magenta, Yellow    Test subpixel combinations
  Black                    Reveal stuck pixels (lit when off)
  White                    Reveal dead pixels (dark when lit)

For a thorough test, check your screen on every color.

Tips
----

- Wipe your screen gently before testing. What looks like a dead
  pixel might just be dust or dirt. InjuredPixels is designed so
  that wiping the screen won't accidentally trigger any actions.

- Test in a dimly lit room for best results. Bright ambient light
  can make subtle defects harder to spot.

- Use fullscreen mode (press F) to test pixels at the very edges
  of your screen, hidden behind browser chrome in normal mode.
